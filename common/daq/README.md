# DAQ Code Generation
Automatic code generation for CAN mesage parsing based on a global CAN JSON configuration

## Adding a Node
In order to configure a new CAN node, add can_parse.c and can_parse.h using the templates to a folder within the node source directory named "can." Change the node name in the header file to match that of the node name in the can_config.json.

## Live JSON Schema Support
To have live JSON schema support add the following to the settings.json file:
'''
{
    "json.schemas": [
    {
        "fileMatch": [
            "can_config.json"
        ],
        "url": "./common/daq/can_schema.json"
    }
    ]
}
'''

## Adding Code Generation as a VSCode Task
Add the following to tasks.json within the .vscode directory:
'''
{
    "label": "can_gen",
    "type": "shell",
    "command": "python ./common/daq/generation/generator.py",
    "problemMatcher": []
}
'''
